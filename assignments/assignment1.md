# Assignment 1 — Problem Framing

## Initial Domains (Brainstorming)
1. **Campus dining and nutrition:** Navigating changing menus and balancing healthy, appealing meals in college dining halls.
2. **Daily reflection:** Supporting self-reflection and journaling with tools that help organize thoughts and experiences.  
3. **Used-car buying and maintenance:** Reducing uncertainty and hidden risks when purchasing or maintaining a used vehicle.
4. **College scheduling and conflicts:** Optimizing schedules to resolve overlapping classes and finish graduation requirements earlier.
5. **Skill barter network:** Finding ways for people to exchange skills or knowledge directly without relying on money.  
6. **Smart collaborative study notes:** Sharing and organizing notes in a way that makes studying more structured and connected.  
7. **Nearby place discovery:** Identifying worthwhile local spots to visit. 
8. **Competitive learning games:** Turning learning into small, fun competitions with friends to build knowledge together.  
9. **Digital time capsule:** Preserving personal memories, thoughts, or media to revisit at a later stage in life.  
10. **Interactive social constellation:** Representing personal networks visually, showing how connections shift and evolve over time.  

## Domains of Interest

1. **Used-car buying and maintenance:** I have always been interested in sports cars, and I know I would like to buy a used BMW after college. At the same time, I am cautious because of what happened when my family bought our first car a few years ago. It was a 2006 Toyota Prius that turned out to be a salvage title, with the odometer rolled back by more than 100,000 miles and several other hidden problems. That experience made me careful about trusting what I see on sites like CarGurus or Carfax, since many repairs and accidents never show up there. Buying a used car should not feel like such a gamble, yet right now it still does.

2. **Nearby place discovery:** I like going out to explore new places, especially when I am with friends or family. This past summer I often tried to find cool places to drive to with my family, but it was harder than I expected. Apps like Yelp, Google Maps, or Instagram gave me endless lists and ratings, but I had trouble figuring out which places would actually feel worth the trip. I usually want to see what the place is like right away, instead of scrolling through pages of reviews that all sound the same. I sometimes feel like I am missing out on great spots nearby simply because they get buried under the more popular ones.

3. **Interactive social constellation:** I think a lot about how my friendships change over time. Some people I talk to every day for a few months, and then we drift apart, while others slowly become more central in my life. Social apps do not show this very well, since they mostly just keep a static list of friends. It feels strange that the way I actually experience relationships—people getting closer or farther away—has no reflection online. I like the idea of being able to see my social world in a way that feels more alive, and that also shows how my friends are connected to one another.

## Problems

**1. Used-car buying and maintenance**  
- **Hidden service and accident history:** Buyers often cannot see unreported repairs or crashes, leaving major risks invisible.  
- **Fraudulent or misleading listings:** Sellers may misrepresent vehicles, inflating prices or hiding defects.  
- **Unclear future repair and ownership costs:** Buyers struggle to anticipate ongoing expenses beyond the initial purchase.  

**2. Nearby place discovery**  
- **Overwhelm from generic reviews and ratings:** Endless lists and repetitive posts create decision fatigue instead of clarity.  
- **Poor personalization to individual interests:** Platforms fail to highlight spots aligned with personal tastes or contexts.  
- **Authenticity issues with fake or incentivized posts:** Reviews are often biased, paid for, or unreliable.  

**3. Interactive social constellation**  
- **Static and lifeless friend lists:** Current apps keep flat lists that fail to show which ties are stronger or fading.  
- **Social feeds emphasize noise over meaningful ties:** Posts prioritize popularity over closeness or connection.  
- **Forgetting to reconnect with drifting friends:** Users lose track of relationships that fade without reminders.  

## Selections & Exclusions

### 1. Used-car buying and maintenance

- **Hidden service and accident history (selected):**  
  > This is the most direct barrier to trust in used-car buying. Platforms like Carfax or CarGurus often miss unreported accidents or repairs, so buyers end up with incomplete information. People who are not car experts may assume a car is clean when it actually has a risky history. This problem feels important because it directly affects confidence in making such a major purchase.

- **Unclear future repair and ownership costs (excluded):**  
  > I chose not to select this problem because predicting future expenses depends heavily on many uncertain factors, such as how the car is driven and maintained. While valuable, it would be very difficult to solve in a reliable way.

- **Fraudulent or misleading listings (excluded):**  
  > I chose not to select this problem because scams are a broad issue in online marketplaces, and addressing them would likely require stricter enforcement and regulation beyond what an app could accomplish alone.

---

### 2. Nearby place discovery

- **Overwhelm from generic reviews and ratings (selected):**  
  > This was the main frustration I faced when trying to find family drive destinations this summer. Apps like Yelp or Google bury users in hundreds of reviews and ratings that rarely help with decision-making. The overload creates decision fatigue, where choosing a place feels more stressful than exciting. This problem is worth selecting because it is common, relatable, and makes discovery less enjoyable than it should be.

- **Poor personalization to individual interests (excluded):**  
  > I chose not to select this problem because personalization overlaps with the overload issue. While important, it feels like a subset of the larger problem of irrelevant reviews.

- **Authenticity issues with fake or incentivized posts (excluded):**  
  > I chose not to select this problem because authenticity is a secondary concern compared to overload. Even if all reviews were genuine, users would still face the same problem of sorting through too much generic information.

---

### 3. Interactive social constellation

- **Static and lifeless friends lists (selected):**  
  > This problem highlights how current apps fail to reflect the way relationships change over time. A flat list of names feels static, while in real life, some friendships strengthen and others fade. It leaves users without a clear sense of which connections are most central at a given moment. Current platforms also make it difficult to see how friends are connected, which limits opportunities to find new connections through existing networks.

- **Social feeds emphasize noise over meaningful ties (excluded):**  
  > I chose not to select this problem because noise in feeds is already being addressed by new platforms like BeReal, and it is less unique than reimagining the structure of the friends list itself.

- **Forgetting to reconnect with drifting friends (excluded):**  
  > I chose not to select this problem because it fits naturally within the friends list issue. If ties were displayed in a more dynamic way, users would already have the cue they need to reconnect.

## Stakeholders for Selected Problems

**1. Hidden service and accident history**  
> Buyer (person purchasing the car and making the decision); Seller or dealer (individual or business listing the vehicle for sale); Mechanic or service shop (party that has records of past repairs or inspections). Impacts: Buyers risk wasting money or ending up with unsafe cars if histories are incomplete. Sellers who are honest lose credibility when bad actors misrepresent vehicles. Mechanics may benefit from having their records recognized but also face concerns about how their data is shared.

**2. Overwhelm from generic reviews and ratings**  
> Explorer (user looking for a place to visit); Local business owner (provides the service or venue); Platform operator (company hosting reviews and discovery features). Impacts: Explorers feel frustrated and overwhelmed by irrelevant or repetitive reviews. Local businesses may be overlooked if buried under generic content or drowned out by more popular competitors. Platform operators face a loss of trust and engagement if users feel discovery is tedious or unhelpful.

**3. Static and lifeless friends lists**  
> User (person maintaining relationships); Network navigator (someone who leverages visibility into mutual connections to reach new people); Platform operator (company providing the social network). Impacts: Users lose awareness of which relationships are most central, making their social networks feel flat. Network navigators miss opportunities to identify X-degree connections that could be valuable for things like jobs, collaborations, or introductions. Platform operators risk disengagement if their platforms fail to reflect the dynamic and useful nature of real-world connections.  

## Evidence and Comparables

### 1. Hidden service and accident history

**Evidence**  
- [Wisconsin DMV reports surge in odometer fraud](https://wisconsindot.gov/Pages/about-wisdot/newsroom/news-rel/051225odometerday.aspx): In 2024, the Wisconsin DMV identified nearly 6,000 vehicles with rolled-back odometers, erasing 613 million miles and inflating values by $37 million. This shows how widespread tampering makes mileage data unreliable, leaving buyers vulnerable to hidden risks.  
- [Cars.com finds widespread title washing](https://notfea.net/storm-surge-beware-of-title-washed-cars/): Some states see extreme rates of title washing, with Carfax estimating nearly 800,000 cars on U.S. roads carrying fraudulently “cleaned” titles. This highlights how buyers can be misled by official documents that fail to reflect a car’s true past.  
- [Flood-damaged cars re-enter resale markets](https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/after-hurricane-ian-floodwaters-receded-flood-damaged-vehicles-hit-resell-market): After Hurricane Ian, thousands of flood-damaged cars were cleaned up and resold nationwide. This shows how serious damage can escape detection in reports, putting unsuspecting buyers at risk.  
- [FTC crackdown exposes hidden auto fraud](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2015/03/ftc-multiple-law-enforcement-partners-announce-crackdown-deception-fraud-auto-sales-financing): The FTC’s Operation Ruse Control led to 252 enforcement actions on odometer fraud and false titles. The scale of violations demonstrates how often vehicle histories are misrepresented, undermining buyer confidence.  
- [AAA warns history reports may omit damage](https://magazine.northeast.aaa.com/daily/money/auto-loans/how-to-avoid-vehicle-history-report-scams): AAA notes that sellers sometimes use outdated or incomplete reports to hide accidents. This shows that even a “clean” history can mislead buyers into purchasing cars with undisclosed damage.  

**Comparables**  
- [Carfax • Vehicle history reports](https://www.carfax.com): Carfax compiles reported accidents, service records, and title brands from official databases. However, it depends entirely on submitted data, so unreported repairs or crashes remain invisible to buyers.  
- [AutoCheck • Auction-focused histories](https://www.autocheck.com): AutoCheck includes auction and dealer data and produces a proprietary vehicle score. It still excludes private repairs and unreported incidents, leaving large gaps in coverage.  
- [NICB VINCheck • Theft and salvage lookup](https://www.nicb.org/vincheck): VINCheck is a free tool that flags stolen and salvage vehicles. Its narrow scope means most accidents and non-totaled damage never appear.  
- [NMVTIS • National title database](https://vehiclehistory.bja.ojp.gov/): NMVTIS reveals branded titles such as salvage or flood, which helps prevent fraud. However, it does not provide any maintenance or inspection records.  
- [NHTSA VIN Decoder • Vehicle specs only](https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/decoder/): The NHTSA decoder provides manufacturer build details like trim and engine configuration. It offers no accident, ownership, or repair data, making it insufficient for used-car buyers.  

---

### 2. Overwhelm from generic reviews and ratings

**Evidence**  
- [Consumers abandon purchases due to review overload](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/information-overload-reviews-overwhelm-shopping-expereience/720658/): Nearly three-quarters of consumers have walked away from purchases because too many reviews made it hard to decide. The same happens when searching for places, where endless review pages create fatigue and push users to give up or default to familiar options.  
- [Published research shows generic reviews diminish impact](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/information-overload-reviews-overwhelm-shopping-expereience/720658/): Studies find that when reviews are too numerous or repetitive, they lose practical value. Instead of aiding decisions, they create cognitive dissonance and make choices harder.  
- [Choice overload reduces decision satisfaction](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265170803_Choice_Overload_A_Conceptual_Review_and_Meta-Analysis): A meta-analysis of 99 studies found that too many options reduce confidence and satisfaction. This parallels how long review lists can overwhelm people trying to pick a place to go.  
- [Americans waste nearly five full days per year deciding what to watch](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lost-stream-survey-finds-americans-140000909.html): A national survey found that people spend 110 hours a year just deciding what to watch on streaming platforms. This highlights how excessive content leads to wasted time, similar to the drag of scanning endless local reviews.  
- [Information overload heightens perceived risk and reduces travel intention](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36389570/): A 2022 study found that tourists facing overwhelming information reported higher perceived risk, which in turn lowered their willingness to travel. This mirrors how an overload of generic reviews can make users feel uncertain and less confident about picking a place to visit.

**Comparables**  
- [Yelp • Local business reviews](https://www.yelp.com): Yelp provides massive coverage of local spots through crowdsourced reviews. However, its long lists of repetitive text often cause decision fatigue instead of simplifying discovery.  
- [Google Maps • Crowdsourced ratings](https://maps.google.com): Google Maps integrates ratings with directions, making it convenient. But its brevity and prevalence of fake reviews make it unreliable for nuanced decisions.  
- [Instagram • Visual discovery via geotags](https://www.instagram.com): Instagram allows exploration of places through geotagged photos. Yet influencer content and promotional posts distort authenticity, making it hard to judge a real “vibe.”  
- [Eater • Curated dining guides](https://www.eater.com): Eater publishes trusted lists curated by food writers. These guides are authoritative but static, and they lack personalization for individual users.  
- [Tripadvisor • Travel-focused reviews](https://www.tripadvisor.com): Tripadvisor helps tourists find attractions with detailed reviews. However, its skew toward out-of-town voices makes it less useful for locals seeking everyday places.

### 3. Static and lifeless friends lists

**Evidence**  
- [Social media paradox: more friends, less connection](https://publichealthpost.org/mental-behavioral-health/the-social-media-paradox-more-friends-less-connection/): A nine-year study found that having more online friends often correlates with greater loneliness. This shows how flat lists of contacts fail to support meaningful connection.  
- [Oxford research finds most online friends aren’t real](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-01-20-how-face-face-still-beats-facebook-0): The average Facebook user had around 155 friends, but only 28% were considered genuine, and just four could be relied upon in a crisis. This highlights how current lists exaggerate closeness and obscure real relationships.  
- [“Friendship recession” leaves 12% of Americans with no close friends](https://www.happiness.hks.harvard.edu/february-2025-issue/the-friendship-recession-the-lost-art-of-connecting): Surveys show the number of adults with no close friends has quadrupled since 1990. This underlines how digital connections do not capture the strength or decline of ties.  
- [Limiting social media reduces loneliness and depression](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751): A randomized trial found that reducing use to 30 minutes per day improved well-being. This demonstrates how current platforms encourage shallow engagement rather than sustaining close relationships.  
- [Passive Facebook use undermines well-being](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25706656/): Experimental evidence shows that passive scrolling lowers affective well-being. Static lists contribute to this by encouraging disengaged use instead of active interaction.  

**Comparables**  
- [LinkedIn • Static professional connections](https://www.linkedin.com): LinkedIn organizes contacts as equal “connections,” ignoring closeness. This makes networks broad but flat and less reflective of real dynamics.  
- [BeReal • Authentic but static](https://bere.al/en): BeReal promotes candid daily posts among close friends. However, it only supports first-degree ties and does not adapt to show which friendships are stronger or fading.  
- [Facebook • Broad but shallow network](https://www.facebook.com): Facebook maintains hundreds of “friends,” regardless of interaction levels. Many ties become inactive, leaving the network bloated and lifeless.  
- [Path • Social network for close friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(social_network)): Path limited networks to small circles for intimacy. Still, it never visualized tie strength dynamically, limiting its long-term appeal.  
- [Gephi • Network visualization software](https://gephi.org/): Gephi maps networks visually for researchers and analysts. However, it is not designed for everyday users to track or manage personal relationships.  



## Features

### Hidden service and accident history  
- **VIN-based risk summary:** Buyers can enter a car’s VIN to receive a simple overview of hidden risks such as odometer tampering, salvage branding, or missing records. This gives non-experts a clear picture of whether a car’s past might hide costly problems.  
- **Repair and cost outlook:** The app translates mileage and vehicle history into likely upcoming repairs, such as brake replacements or timing belt changes, along with estimated costs. This helps buyers feel more confident about long-term ownership.  
- **Trust score for each listing:** Each car is assigned a trust score that combines accident history, service gaps, and seller credibility. This lets buyers quickly compare vehicles without having to analyze raw reports.

### Overwhelm from generic reviews and ratings  
- **Interactive photo map:** Instead of scrolling through text reviews, users can browse an interactive map filled with authentic photos of places, similar to Apple Photos’ map view. This makes it easy to get an immediate sense of a location’s vibe before visiting.  
- **Interest-based filtering:** Users can filter destinations based on personal interests, such as quiet cafés for studying or lively restaurants for groups. This reduces irrelevant options and makes discovery feel more personal.  
- **Community highlight reels:** Places are summarized through short, visual highlight reels curated from visitor contributions. This balances authenticity with simplicity, helping users see what stands out most without being overwhelmed.  

---

### Static and lifeless friends lists  
- **Dynamic constellation view:** Connections are shown as stars in a constellation, brightening as people interact more and fading as ties weaken. This makes relationships feel more alive and reflective of real-world dynamics.  
- **Connection pathways:** Users can see how they are linked to friends-of-friends, with shared contexts highlighted along the way. This creates opportunities to discover new connections or reconnect with people through mutual ties.  
- **Relationship reminders:** The app provides subtle prompts when important ties begin to fade. These reminders encourage healthier engagement without overwhelming users with notifications.
