# Assignment 2 — Functional Design

## Problem Statement

**Domain: Nearby Place Discovery**

I love exploring new places, especially aesthetic nature spots, scenic overlooks, and unique food spots. Finding a hidden trail with a great view or a small restaurant that becomes a favorite feels exciting and memorable. I often go on spontaneous drives with friends or family just to see what we can discover, and those trips usually become some of my favorite memories. For me, nearby place discovery is about making exploration feel easy and fun without having to travel far or visit another city or country.

**Problem: Overwhelm from Generic Reviews and Ratings**

Many people like me struggle when trying to find new nearby places. Platforms like Google Maps, Yelp, and Instagram flood us with endless lists and repetitive reviews that all start to look the same. Even with ratings and photos, it is hard to tell which spots are truly worth visiting. Instead of feeling inspired, we spend too much time scrolling and often end up defaulting to the same familiar places. What should be a fun and energizing process of discovery becomes a stressful chore that discourages exploration and takes away the sense of adventure.

**Stakeholders**

- ***Explorer***: The primary user eager to find new spots but frustrated by endless reviews and drained by decision fatigue.
- ***Platform Operator***: The company hosting the discovery service that risks losing user trust and engagement when discovery feels slow and tedious.
- ***Local Business Owner***: The venue operator whose unique qualities get lost in generic ratings, causing them to be overlooked despite the great experience they may offer.

**Evidence & Comparables**

- [Consumers abandon purchases due to review overload (***Evidence***)](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/information-overload-reviews-overwhelm-shopping-expereience/720658/): Nearly three-quarters of consumers walk away from purchases because too many reviews made decision-making difficult, showing how review overwhelm directly leads to user abandonment.
- [Published research shows generic reviews diminish impact (***Evidence***)](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/information-overload-reviews-overwhelm-shopping-expereience/720658/): Studies find that when reviews are too numerous or repetitive, they lose practical value. Instead of aiding decisions, they create cognitive dissonance and make choices harder.
- [Choice overload reduces decision satisfaction (***Evidence***)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265170803_Choice_Overload_A_Conceptual_Review_and_Meta-Analysis): A meta-analysis of 99 studies found that excessive options reduce confidence and satisfaction, paralleling how long review lists overwhelm people choosing places to visit.
- [Americans waste nearly five full days per year deciding what to watch (***Evidence***)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lost-stream-survey-finds-americans-140000909.html): A national survey found that people spend over 110 hours a year just deciding what to watch on streaming platforms, showing how content overload wastes time and mirrors the drag of scrolling through endless local reviews.
- [Yelp • Local business reviews (***Comparable***)](https://www.yelp.com): Yelp provides massive coverage of local spots through crowdsourced reviews. However, its long lists of repetitive text often cause decision fatigue instead of simplifying discovery.  
- [Google Maps • Crowdsourced ratings (***Comparable***)](https://maps.google.com): Google Maps integrates ratings with directions, making it convenient. But its brevity and prevalence of fake or generic reviews make it unreliable for nuanced decisions.  
- [Tripadvisor • Travel-focused reviews (***Comparable***)](https://www.tripadvisor.com): Tripadvisor helps tourists find attractions with detailed reviews. However, its skew toward out-of-town voices makes it less useful for locals seeking everyday places.
